A function declaration consists of a function name followed by a routine body. The routine body is the statement block.\n","\n","The following is an example in pseudocode.\n","\n",">```text\n",">1 FUNCTION square(n : INTEGER) : INTEGER\n",">2    result ← n * n\n",">3    RETURN result\n",">4 ENDFUNCTION\n",">```\n","\n","From the above example, we notice that the function declaration includes:\n","\n","- The identifier or name of the function (i.e., `square`)\n","- The parameter(s) (i.e., input variable(s)) for the function (i.e., the single input variable `n : INTEGER`)\n","\n","Correspondingly, the function body contains:\n","\n","- The various statements that define what the function does (i.e., each line after the function header/interface)\n","- A statement that gives the function a value to return (i.e., the `return result` statement on the last line)\n","\n","Essentially, when we define a function, we use an ordered list of variables, termed **parameters**, to be supplied into the function. E.g., `n` is a parameter in the example above.\n","\n","When the function is called with an actual input, the input is called an **argument**, i.e., the arguments supplied are assigned to the corresponding parameter of the routine. Do note the order of the parameters in the parameter list must be the same as the order in the list of arguments. Using our example above, in the expression `square(2)`, `2` is the argument.\n","\n","When an executed program gets to the statement that includes a function call as part of the expression, the function is executed. The value returned from this function call is then used in the expression. Thus, with the above line of code, the result of the `square(2)` function call is assigned to the variable `result`.\n","\n","In Python, we declare a function with the following syntax:\n","\n",">```python\n",">def function_name(parameters):\n",">\tstatement/statements\n",">   return some_value\n",">```\n","\n","* Keyword `def` marks the start of a function.\n","* Every function has an user defined name as unique identifier. In the example above it's `function_name`\n","* It takes in values, known as **parameters**, before running the code block.\n","* It may return value as a result using `return` statement.\n","    * If no `return` statement, the function will return the `None` data type at the end of the function.\n","* All statements must be equally indented, which is usually 4 spaces.\n","\n","**Note:** Do not indent your program with mix of spaces and tabs.\n","\n","#### Example\n","The program to implement the function defined by the following pseudocode  \n","\n",">```coffeescript\n",">1 FUNCTION square(n : INTEGER) : INTEGER\n",">2    result ← n * n\n",">3    RETURN result\n",">4 ENDFUNCTION\n",">```\n","\n","in Python looks like:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"T0aTxx5zrCZs","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1736000816036,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Tee Ti","userId":"01570049436197552602"}},"outputId":"55be84bb-efbf-4ea9-9070-fec358a189fe"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["16\n","121\n"]}],"source":["def square(n):\n","    result = n * n\n","    return result\n","\n","print(square(4))\n","print(square(11))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"cLW-IousrCZw"},"source":["#### Exercise\n","Write a **function** named `my_circle_area` that takes in a float $r$ as a parameter and returns a float that represents the area of a circle with radius $r$."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"C2DQknZhrCZy","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1738199346478,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":272,"user":{"displayName":"Tee Ti","userId":"01570049436197552602"}},"outputId":"40f5a185-00e8-4d97-b9f8-a7799feb1843"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["12.566370614359172\n"]}],"source":["# YOUR_CODE_HERE\n","\n","import math ##need to import maths library.
