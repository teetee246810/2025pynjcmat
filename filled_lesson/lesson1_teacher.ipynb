    "> **Definition**\n",

    "> A *program* is the actual expression of an algorithm in a specific programming language. It allows the computer to execute the problem solution through a sequence of instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics, we encounter the notion of expression and statement. A mathematical expression is a written arrangement of symbols following the context-dependent, syntactic conventions of mathematical notation. Whereas, a mathematical statement is\n",
    "a declarative sentence that is either true or false but not both.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "- $2x + 1 = 0$ is a mathematical expression.\n",
    "- $\\forall x.2x + 1 = 0$ is a mathematical statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in computing, the definition, although kinda related, is different. For the subsequent parts, when we say expression and statement, they refer to the definition given below.\n",

    ">A *statement* in a programming language, on the other hand, is a syntactic entity, which has no value (merely an instruction.)\n",

    ">```python\n",
    ">answers = 1 + 1                 # '1+1' is an expression\n",
    ">\n",
    ">if answers == 2:\n",
    ">   print('Good Outlook')       # print('Good Outlook') is a statement.\n",
    ">```\n",

    "> **Definition**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In computing, a *variable* corresponds to an identifier that references a unit of data in computer memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, a **variable** represents an entity which holds a **value**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to define a variable, we must utilise the **assignment statement**. Variables must be **initialised** (i.e. assigned with a value) before use.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how assignment and variables work, let us refer to the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    "># x is the variable, 100 is the data, ← is the assignment operator\n",
    "># and the whole line below is the assignment statement\n",
    ">x ← 100\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above is a typical assignment statement. We are specifying a variable, i.e., an identifier `x`, which will reference some part of the computer’s memory, and in that segment of computer memory, store the integer value `100`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, the assignment statement does 3 things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Stores the variable identifier in an identifier table\n",
    "2. Allocates computer memory for the storage of the data type value specified; the memory allocated will correspond to some specific location in memory - i.e., a memory address\n",
    "3. Links the variable identifier to the computer memory location\n",
    "\n",
    "In this manner, whenever the variable is used, the computer knows that we are referring to the value that is stored in the associated location in computer memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignment also allows programmers to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assign new values to a variable\n",
    "2. Copy variable values\n",
    "3. Swap values between variables\n",
    "\n",
    "It should also be noted that when assigning a value, that value may be computed using expressions consisting of arithmetic, logical, comparison and/or string operations. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    ">x ← 10 + 20\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "Such expressions can, and or course, often do include the specification of other variables. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    ">result ← a*x**2 + b*x + c\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the assignment operator is `=` , which should not be confused with the equal sign $=$ from mathematics.\n",

    "The way to write assignment statement in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "var = assigned_value\n",

    "## Logical Error\n",
    "Logical errors are trickier because they don't stop your program from running but produce incorrect results. These errors occur when your code does something unintended due to a flaw in your logic. For example, using the wrong formula to calculate the area of a circle `area = 2 * pi * r` instead of `area = pi * r ** 2` will not raise an error but will yield the wrong answer. Debugging logical errors requires careful analysis of your code, often using tools like `print()` statements, logging, or debugging environments to trace the flow of execution and verify intermediate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "While syntax and type errors are easier to identify and fix due to Python's helpful error messages, logical errors demand a deeper understanding of your program's intent and logic. Knowing how to address each error type ensures smoother programming and fewer bugs in your code."
