A flowchart visually represents the logic of a program, using shapes like ovals for start/end, rectangles for processes, diamonds for decisions, and arrows to indicate flow.\n","\n","Some flowchart includes instructions to declare the variable names and its types. While this is a good practice, there is no need to do it in Python. As such, we will ignore such instructions.\n","\n","Here’s a step-by-step guide:\n","\n","1. **Identify Start and End Points**: Begin by locating the flowchart's start and end points. These indicate where your program should begin and terminate, can be represented as `print(\"Start\")` and `print(\"End\")` in Python for clarity.\n","\n","2. **Identify Input and Outputs**: They are represented in the parallelogram. These input and outputs are translated into Python's `input()` and `print()` functions.\n","\n","3. **Translate Processes**: Processes in a flowchart (rectangles) represent tasks or computations. Each process is translated into Python statements. For instance, \"Calculate area = length × width\" becomes:\n","\n","    ```python\n","    area = length * width\n","    ```\n","\n","4. **Handle Decisions**: Decisions (diamonds) are conditions that lead to different outcomes. Translate these into `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements. For example, a decision like \"Is x > 0?\" becomes:\n","\n","    ```python\n","    if x > 0:\n","        # Code for True path\n","    else:\n","        # Code for False path\n","    ```\n","\n","5. **Represent Loops**: Repeated paths in a flowchart indicate loops. Convert these into `while` or `for` loops in Python. For instance, a loop with the condition \"Repeat until x < 10\" translates to:\n","\n","    ```python\n","    while x < 10:\n","        # Code to repeat\n","    ```\n","\n","6. **Follow Arrows for Flow**: The arrows in the flowchart define the order of execution. Ensure your Python code follows this logical sequence by structuring statements accordingly."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"X3e-mpbgXESg"},"source":["#### Exercise 1: [Invitation to Code Part 3] Print 1 to 100\n","Translate the following flowchart \"Print 1 to 100\" into Python code.\n","\n","You can find the flowchart\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","*   extracted from the textbook with explanations [here](https://github.com/teetee246810/2025pynjcmat/blob/main/flowcharts%20from%20textbook/print_to_100.jpg).\n","*   generated by mermaid [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dweQ70YuX0VvWbJsbY6REuol-AcDhitq/view?usp=drive_link)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"kNny8f--XESj"},"outputs":[],"source":["#YOUR_CODE_HERE"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"LKS7kPVYXESm"},"source":["#### Exercise 2: [Invitation to Code Part 1] Area of circle\n","Translate the following flowchart into Python code.\n","\n","You can find the flowchart\n","\n","*   extracted from the textbook with explanations [here](https://github.com/teetee246810/2025pynjcmat/blob/main/flowcharts%20from%20textbook/circle_area.jpg).\n","*   generated by mermaid [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1afoL9u7gqnQSxLEdlvjVf31iewq8sihE/view?usp=sharing)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"n-ISPUmsXESo"},"outputs":[],"source":["#YOUR_CODE_HERE"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HVCm3bWHXESo"},"source":["#### Exercise 3: [Invitation to Code] Odd even checker\n","Translate the following flowchart into Python code.\n","\n","You can find the flowchart\n","\n","*   extracted from the textbook with explanations [here](https://github.com/teetee246810/2025pynjcmat/blob/main/flowcharts%20from%20textbook/odd_even_checker.jpg).\n","*   generated by mermaid [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15DpeYoYklaU3NqxKn5X7vS1eSi2JpzAL/view?usp=sharing)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"ND6HO6MaXESp"},"outputs":[],"source":["# YOUR_CODE_HERE"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"UQ8eJ43TXESq"},"source":["#### Exercise 4: [Invitation to Code Part 6] Nature of roots\n","Translate the following flowchart into Python code.\n","\n","You can find the flowchart\n","\n","*   extracted from the textbook with explanations [here](https://github.com/teetee246810/2025pynjcmat/blob/main/flowcharts%20from%20textbook/nature_of_roots.jpg).\n","*   generated by mermaid [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gBkWaLrJvGbn3WP6-j5kjgPrKwUDNOpj/view?usp=sharing)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"0S0g2OQPXESr"},"outputs":[],"source":["# YOUR_CODE_HERE"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"FbRt6tC8XESr"},"source":["## Mathematical Functions In Python\n","In mathematics, there are several standard functions which we haven't touched upon until now.
