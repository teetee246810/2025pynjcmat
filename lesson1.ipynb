    "\n",
    "In other words, a **variable** represents an entity which holds a **value**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to define a variable, we must utilise the **assignment statement**. Variables must be **initialised** (i.e. assigned with a value) before use.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how assignment and variables work, let us refer to the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    "># x is the variable, 100 is the data, ← is the assignment operator\n",
    "># and the whole line below is the assignment statement\n",
    ">x ← 100\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Essentially, the assignment statement does 3 things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Stores the variable identifier in an identifier table\n",
    "2. Allocates computer memory for the storage of the data type value specified; the memory allocated will correspond to some specific location in memory - i.e., a memory address\n",
    "3. Links the variable identifier to the computer memory location\n",

    "Assignment also allows programmers to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assign new values to a variable\n",
    "2. Copy variable values\n",
    "3. Swap values between variables\n",
    "\n",
    "It should also be noted that when assigning a value, that value may be computed using expressions consisting of arithmetic, logical, comparison and/or string operations. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    ">x ← 10 + 20\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "Such expressions can, and or course, often do include the specification of other variables. For example:\n",

    "# Commonly Encountered Errors and Debugging\n",
    "Errors in Python come in various forms, each indicating a different kind of problem in your code. Encountering errors is part and parcel of programming and the important thing is knowing how to correct the program to avoid the errors. This process of correction is termed **debugging**\n",

    "## Type Error\n",
    "Type errors, on the other hand, arise when an operation is applied to an incompatible data type. For example, trying to add a string to an integer \n",

    "```python\n",
    "\"3\" + 5 \n",

    "will raise a TypeError because Python doesn't know how to combine these types. Type errors often happen when you mix data types without proper typecasting, such as trying to divide a list by a number or calling a function with the wrong data type as an argument. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is akin to trying to use mathematical function with elements not found in the domain of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logical Error\n",
    "Logical errors are trickier because they don't stop your program from running but produce incorrect results. These errors occur when your code does something unintended due to a flaw in your logic. For example, using the wrong formula to calculate the area of a circle `area = 2 * pi * r` instead of `area = pi * r ** 2` will not raise an error but will yield the wrong answer. Debugging logical errors requires careful analysis of your code, often using tools like `print()` statements, logging, or debugging environments to trace the flow of execution and verify intermediate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "While syntax and type errors are easier to identify and fix due to Python's helpful error messages, logical errors demand a deeper understanding of your program's intent and logic. Knowing how to address each error type ensures smoother programming and fewer bugs in your code."
