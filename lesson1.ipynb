    "\n",
    "In order to process data, we typically need to store it in computer memory. This is done via the use of variables. You might be familiar with variables given their use in mathematics. However, variables in mathematics and computing are different.\n",

    "> In computing, a *variable* corresponds to an identifier that references a unit of data in computer memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, a **variable** represents an entity which holds a **value**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to define a variable, we must utilise the **assignment statement**. Variables must be **initialised** (i.e. assigned with a value) before use.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how assignment and variables work, let us refer to the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    "># x is the variable, 100 is the data, ← is the assignment operator\n",
    "># and the whole line below is the assignment statement\n",
    ">x ← 100\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above is a typical assignment statement. We are specifying a variable, i.e., an identifier `x`, which will reference some part of the computer’s memory, and in that segment of computer memory, store the integer value `100`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, the assignment statement does 3 things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Stores the variable identifier in an identifier table\n",
    "2. Allocates computer memory for the storage of the data type value specified; the memory allocated will correspond to some specific location in memory - i.e., a memory address\n",
    "3. Links the variable identifier to the computer memory location\n",
    "\n",
    "In this manner, whenever the variable is used, the computer knows that we are referring to the value that is stored in the associated location in computer memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignment also allows programmers to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assign new values to a variable\n",
    "2. Copy variable values\n",
    "3. Swap values between variables\n",
    "\n",
    "It should also be noted that when assigning a value, that value may be computed using expressions consisting of arithmetic, logical, comparison and/or string operations. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    ">x ← 10 + 20\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "Such expressions can, and or course, often do include the specification of other variables. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    ">result ← a*x**2 + b*x + c\n",
    ">```\n",

    "# Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In computing, a function corresponds to a sequence of steps that is given an identifier and returns a single value; a function call must be part of an expression (since it returns a value).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notion of function is similar to the mathematical function with some differences that we would mention later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Declaring and Calling a Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to define a function in Python, we must first declare it. A function declaration consists of a function name followed by a routine body. The routine body is the statement block.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is an example in pseudocode. \n",
    "\n",
    ">```text\n",
    ">1 FUNCTION square(n : INTEGER) : INTEGER\n",
    ">2    result ← n * n\n",
    ">3    RETURN result\n",
    ">4 ENDFUNCTION\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above example, we notice that the function declaration includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The identifier or name of the function (i.e., `square`)\n",
    "- The parameter(s) (i.e., input variable(s)) for the function (i.e., the single input variable `n : INTEGER`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Correspondingly, the function body contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The various statements that define what the function does (i.e., each line after the function header/interface)\n",
    "- A statement that gives the function a value to return (i.e., the `return result` statement on the last line)\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, when we define a function, we use an ordered list of variables, termed **parameters**, to be supplied into the function. E.g., `n` is a parameter in the example above. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the function is called with an actual input, the input is called an **argument**, i.e., the arguments supplied are assigned to the corresponding parameter of the routine. Do note the order of the parameters in the parameter list must be the same as the order in the list of arguments. Using our example above, in the expression `square(2)`, `2` is the argument. \n",
    "\n",
    "When an executed program gets to the statement that includes a function call as part of the expression, the function is executed. The value returned from this function call is then used in the expression. Thus, with the above line of code, the result of the `square(2)` function call is assigned to the variable `result`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we declare a function with the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    ">def function_name(parameters):\n",
    ">\tstatement/statements\n",
    ">   return some_value\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Keyword `def` marks the start of a function.\n",
    "* Every function has an user defined name as unique identifier. In the example above it's `function_name` \n",
    "* It takes in values, known as **parameters**, before running the code block.\n",
    "* It may return value as a result using `return` statement.\n",
    "    * If no `return` statement, the function will return the `None` data type at the end of the function. \n",
    "* All statements must be equally indented, which is usually 4 spaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Do not indent your program with mix of spaces and tabs. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "The program to implement the function defined by the following pseudocode  \n",
    "\n",
    ">```coffeescript\n",
    ">1 FUNCTION square(n : INTEGER) : INTEGER\n",
    ">2    result ← n * n\n",
    ">3    RETURN result\n",
    ">4 ENDFUNCTION\n",
